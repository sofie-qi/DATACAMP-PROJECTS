Many males with the same name\n<p>Wow, Olivia has had a meteoric rise! Let's take a look at traditionally male names now. We saw in the first task that there are nine traditionally male names given to at least 5,000 babies every single year in our 101-year dataset! Those names are classics, but showing up in the dataset every year doesn't necessarily mean that the timeless names were the most popular. Let's explore popular male names a little further.</p>\n<p>In the next two tasks, we will build up to listing every year along with the most popular male name in that year. This presents a common problem: how do we find the greatest X in a group? Or, in the context of this problem, how do we find the male name given to the highest number of babies in a year? </p>\n<p>In SQL, one approach is to use a subquery. We can first write a query that selects the <code>year</code> and the maximum <code>num</code> of babies given any single male name in that year. For example, in 1989, the male name given to the highest number of babies was given to 65,339 babies. We'll write this query in this task. In the next task, we can use the code from this task as a subquery to look up the <code>first_name</code> that was given to 65,339 babies in 1989… as well as the top male first name for all other years!</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"43"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\n\nSELECT year, max(num) as max_num\nFROM baby_names\nWHERE sex = 'M'\nGROUP BY year\nLIMIT 10;\n\n","execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":" * postgresql:///names\n10 rows affected.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":12,"data":{"text/plain":"[(1970, 85291),\n (2000, 34483),\n (1947, 94764),\n (1962, 85041),\n (1975, 68451),\n (1980, 68704),\n (1931, 60518),\n (1981, 68776),\n (2013, 18266),\n (1972, 71401)]","text/html":"<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>year</th>\n            <th>max_num</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1970</td>\n            <td>85291</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2000</td>\n            <td>34483</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1947</td>\n            <td>94764</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1962</td>\n            <td>85041</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1975</td>\n            <td>68451</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1980</td>\n            <td>68704</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1931</td>\n            <td>60518</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1981</td>\n            <td>68776</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2013</td>\n            <td>18266</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1972</td>\n            <td>71401</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"50"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.
